# The K.H.I. Project
Have you ever found yourself away from your local Kingdom Hall... Not remembering if you have a part next week?<br>
I know I have! That's why in 2015 I set out on a mission to make scheduling easier. 

> Back then I was using a basic wordpress site.<br>
> I would upload new blog post every week with new schedules.
